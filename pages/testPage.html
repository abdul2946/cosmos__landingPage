					This course is fully up-to-date with React 18 (the latest version of
					React)!
					<br>
					It was completely updated and re-recorded from the ground up -
					it teaches the very latest version of React with all the core, modern
					features you need to know!
					<br />
					---
					<br />
					This course also comes with two paths which you can take: The
					"complete" path (full >40h course) and the "summary" path (~4h summary
					module) - you can choose the path that best fits your time
					requirements! :-)

					<br />
					---
					<br />
					React.js is THE most popular JavaScript library you can use and learn
					these days to build modern, reactive user interfaces for the web.
					<br />
					This course teaches you React in-depth, from the ground up, step by
					step by diving into all the core basics, exploring tons of examples
					and also introducing you to advanced concepts as well.
					<br />
					You'll get all the theory, tons of examples and demos, assignments and
					exercises and tons of important knowledge that is skipped by most
					other resources - after all, there is a reason why this course is that
					huge! :)
					<br />
					And in case you don't even know why you would want to learn React and
					you're just here because of some ad or "the algorithm" - no worries:
					ReactJS is a key technology as a web developer and in this course I
					will also explain WHY it's that important!
